* feat(planning): apply autoware_agnocast_wrapper to diffussion planner trajectory pipeline nodes for CIE (`#12779 <https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware_universe/issues/12779>`_)
  * feat(autoware_diffusion_planner): apply autoware_agnocast_wrapper for CIE

  ---------
* feat(trajectory_selector): combine validator and concatenator (`#12532 <https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware_universe/issues/12532>`_)
  * feat(concatenator): add concatenator
  * feat: combine concatenator with validator
  * fix: remove explicit find package, and pre-commit
  * fix: failing test
  * fix: create public interface for concatenator, and move concatenator to detail folder
  * feat: separate validator to validator interface and initialize selector
  * fix loading parameters
  * fix(node): publish validated trajectories; remove dead member and unjustified mutable
  on_timer() computed the validated result but never called publish(), making
  the node a no-op at the output. Both integration tests were silently timing
  out because of this.
  Also removed sub_trajectories\_ which was declared but never assigned in
  subscribers(), and dropped the unjustified `mutable` qualifier from
  time_keeper\_ (no const method ever writes to it).

  * fix(validator_interface): use validator_ptr\_ in validate_trajectories
  validate_trajectories() was constructing a new TrajectoryValidator on
  every call (copying the plugins\_ vector each time) instead of using the
  validator_ptr\_ member that is initialized in the constructor for exactly
  this purpose. validator_ptr\_ was live memory that was never called.

  * fix(validator_interface): remove redundant diagnostics clear; merge duplicate DebugPublisher
  Two cleanups in validate_trajectories / publishers():
  1. The first diagnostics_interface_ptr\_->clear() was dead work: the
  diagnostics are cleared again five lines later, just before the
  add_key_value loop, so the first call never had observable effect.
  2. pub_validation_reports\_ and pub_debug\_ were both initialized to a
  DebugPublisher with the identical prefix "~/debug". A single
  DebugPublisher handles multiple sub-topics; the duplicate object
  added confusion without benefit. Removed pub_validation_reports\_ and
  routed its one call-site through pub_debug\_.
